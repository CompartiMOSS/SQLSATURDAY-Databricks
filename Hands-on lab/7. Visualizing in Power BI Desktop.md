## Exercise 7: Visualizing in Power BI Desktop

Duration: 20 minutes

In this exercise, you will create visualizations in Power BI Desktop.

### Task 1: Obtain the JDBC connection string to your Azure Databricks cluster

Before you begin, you must first obtain the JDBC connection string to your Azure Databricks cluster.

1. In Azure Databricks, go to Clusters and select your cluster.

2. On the cluster edit page, scroll down to the bottom of the page, expand **Advanced Options**, then select the **JDBC/ODBC** tab.

   ![Select the JDBC/ODBC tab](media/databricks-power-bi-jdbc.png 'JDBC strings')

3. On the **JDBC/ODBC** tab, copy and save the first JDBC URL.

   - Construct the JDBC server address that you will use when you set up your Spark cluster connection in Power BI Desktop.

   - Take the JDBC URL that you copied and saved in step 3 and do the following:

   - Replace `jdbc:spark` with `https`.

   - Remove everything in the path between the port number and sql, retaining the components indicated by the boxes in the image below. Also remove `;AuthMech=3;UID=token;PWD=<personal-access-token>` from the end of the string.

   ![Select the parts to create the Power BI connection string](media/databricks-power-bi-spark-address-construct.png 'Construct Power BI connection string')

   - In our example, the server address would be:

   <https://westus2.azuredatabricks.net:443/sql/protocolv1/o/2035768554230150/0603-160328-rage709> or <https://westus2.azuredatabricks.net:443/sql/protocolv1/o/2035768554230150/lab> (if you choose the aliased version)

### Task 2: Connect to Azure Databricks using Power BI Desktop

1. If you did not already do so during the before the hands-on lab setup, download Power BI Desktop from https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/

2. When Power BI Desktop starts, you will need to enter your personal information, or Sign in if you already have an account.

   ![The Power BI Desktop Welcome page displays.](media/image177.png 'Power BI Desktop Welcome page')

3. Select Get data on the screen that is displayed next.
   ![On the Power BI Desktop Sign in page, in the pane, Get data is selected.](media/image178.png 'Power BI Desktop Sign in page')

4. Select **Other** from the side, and select **Spark** from the list of available data sources.

   ![In the pane of the Get Data page, Other is selected. In the pane, Spark is selected.](media/pbi-desktop-get-data.png 'Get Data page')

5. Select **Connect**.

6. On the next screen, you will be prompted for your Spark cluster information.

7. Paste the JDBC connection string you constructed a few steps ago into the **Server** field.

8. Select the **HTTP** protocol.

9. Select **DirectQuery** for the Data Connectivity mode, and select **OK**. This option will offload query tasks to the Azure Databricks Spark cluster, providing near-real time querying.

   ![Configure your connection to the Spark cluster](media/pbi-desktop-connect-spark.png 'Spark form')

10. Enter your credentials on the next screen as follows:

    - User name: **token**

    - Password: Remember that ADF Access token we generated and asked you to paste in Notepad, that is the password.

    ![Copy the generated token](media/databricks-copy-token.png 'Copy generated token')

    ![Enter "token" for the user name and paste user token into the password field](media/pbi-desktop-login.png 'Enter credentials')

11. Select **Connect**.

12. In the Navigator dialog, check the box next to **flight_delays_summary**, and select **Load**.

    ![In the Navigator dialog box, in the pane under Display Options, the check box for flight_delays_summary is selected. In the pane, the table of flight delays summary information displays.](media/pbi-desktop-select-table-navigator.png 'Navigator dialog box')

13. It will take several minutes for the data to load into the Power BI Desktop client.

### Task 3: Create Power BI report

1. Once the data finishes loading, you will see the fields appear on the far side of the Power BI Desktop client window.

   ![Power BI Desktop fields](media/pbi-desktop-fields.png 'Power BI Desktop Fields')

2. From the Visualizations area, next to Fields, select the Globe icon to add a Map visualization to the report design surface.

   ![On the Power BI Desktop Visualizations palette, the globe icon is selected.](media/image187.png 'Power BI Desktop Visualizatoins palette')

3. With the Map visualization still selected, drag the **OriginLatLong** field to the **Location** field under Visualizations. Then Next, drag the **NumDelays** field to the **Size** field under Visualizations.

   ![In the Fields column, the check boxes for NumDelays and OriginLatLong are selected. An arrow points from OriginLatLong in the Fields column, to OriginLatLong in the Visualization's Location field. A second arrow points from NumDelays in the Fields column, to NumDelays in the Visualization's Size field.](media/pbi-desktop-configure-map-vis.png 'Visualizations and Fields columns')

4. You should now see a map that looks similar to the following (resize and zoom on your map if necessary):

   ![On the Report design surface, a Map of the United States displays with varying-sized dots over different cities.](media/pbi-desktop-map-vis.png 'Report design surface')

5. Unselect the Map visualization by selecting the white space next to the map in the report area.

6. From the Visualizations area, select the **Stacked Column Chart** icon to add a bar chart visual to the report's design surface.

   ![The stacked column chart icon is selected on the Visualizations palette.](media/image190.png 'Visualizations palette')

7. With the Stacked Column Chart still selected, drag the **DayofMonth** field and drop it into the **Axis** field located under Visualizations.

8. Next, drag the **NumDelays** field over, and drop it into the **Value** field.

   ![In the Fields column, the check boxes for NumDelays and DayofMonth are selected. An arrow points from NumDelays in the Fields column, to NumDelays in the Visualization's Axis field. A second arrow points from DayofMonth in the Fields column, to DayofMonth in the Visualization's Value field.](media/pbi-desktop-configure-stacked-vis.png 'Visualizations and Fields columns')

9. Grab the corner of the new Stacked Column Chart visual on the report design surface, and drag it out to make it as wide as the bottom of your report design surface. It should look something like the following.

   ![On the Report Design Surface, under the map of the United States with dots, a stacked bar chart displays.](media/pbi-desktop-stacked-vis.png 'Report Design Surface')

10. Unselect the Stacked Column Chart visual by selecting on the white space next to the map on the design surface.

11. From the Visualizations area, select the Treemap icon to add this visualization to the report.

    ![On the Visualizations palette, the Treemap icon is selected.](media/image193.png 'Visualizations palette')

12. With the Treemap visualization selected, drag the **OriginAirportCode** field into the **Group** field under Visualizations.

13. Next, drag the **NumDelays** field over, and drop it into the **Values** field.

    ![In the Fields column, the check boxes for NumDelays and OriginAirportcode are selected. An arrow points from NumDelays in the Fields column, to NumDelays in the Visualization's Values field. A second arrow points from OriginAirportcode in the Fields column, to OriginAirportcode in the Visualization's Group field.](media/pbi-desktop-config-treemap-vis.png 'Visualizations and Fields columns')

14. Grab the corner of the Treemap visual on the report design surface, and expand it to fill the area between the map and the side edge of the design surface. The report should now look similar to the following.

    ![The Report design surface now displays the map of the United States with dots, a stacked bar chart, and a Treeview.](media/pbi-desktop-full-report.png 'Report design surface')

15. You can cross filter any of the visualizations on the report by selecting one of the other visuals within the report, as shown below (This may take a few seconds to change, as the data is loaded).

    ![The map on the Report design surface is now zoomed in on the northeast section of the United States, and the only dot on the map is on Chicago. In the Treeview, all cities except ORD are grayed out. In the stacked bar graph, each bar is now divided into a darker and a lighter color, with the darker color representing the airport.](media/pbi-desktop-full-report-filter.png 'Report design surface')

16. You can save the report, by choosing Save from the File menu, and entering a name and location for the file.
