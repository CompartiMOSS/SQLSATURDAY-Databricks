## Exercise 8: Deploy intelligent web app (Optional Lab)

Duration: 20 minutes

In this exercise, you will deploy an intelligent web application to Azure from GitHub. This application leverages the operationalized machine learning model that was deployed in Exercise 1 to bring action-oriented insight to an already existing business process.

### Task 1: Register for a trial API account at darksky.net

To retrieve the 7-day hourly weather forecast, you will use an API from darksky.net. There is a free trial version that provides you access to the API you need for this hands-on lab.

1. Navigate to <https://darksky.net/dev>.

2. Select TRY FOR FREE.

   ![Select the TRY FOR FREE button on the Dark Sky dev page](media/dark-sky-api-try-for-free.png 'Dark Sky dev page')

3. Complete the Register form by providing your email address and a password. Select REGISTER.

   ![Complete the registration form and select REGISTER](media/dark-sky-register.png 'Registration form')

4. Check your email account you used for registration. You should have a confirmation email from Dark Sky. Open the email and follow the confirmation link within to complete the registration process. When the welcome page loads, log in with your new account.

5. After logging in, you will be directed to the Your Account page. Take note of your **Secret Key** and copy it to a text editor such as Notepad for later. You will need this key to make API calls later in the lab.

6. To verify that your API Key is working, follow the link on the bottom of the page located underneath Sample API Call. You should see a JSON result that looks similar to the following:

### Task 2: Deploy web app from GitHub

1. Navigate to <https://github.com/Microsoft/MCW-Big-data-and-visualization/blob/master/Hands-on%20lab/lab-files/BigDataTravel/README.md> in your browser of choice, but where you are already authenticated to the Azure portal.

2. Read through the README information on the GitHub page.

3. Select **Deploy to Azure**.

4. On the following page, ensure the fields are populated correctly.

   - Ensure the correct Directory and Subscription are selected.

   - Select the Resource Group that you have been using throughout this lab.

   - Either keep the default Site name, or provide one that is globally unique, and then choose a Site Location.

   - Enter Weather API information

   - Finally, enter the ML URL. We got that from Azure databricks Notebook #3 in the Exercise 2 folder. If you cleaned your resources at the end of this Notebook #3, you will need to re-run it and keep that web service running to get its associated URL.

   ![Fields on the Deploy to Azure page are populated with the previously copied information.](media/azure-deployment-form.png 'Deploy to Azure page')

5. Select **Next**, and on the following screen, select **Deploy**.

6. The page should begin deploying your application while showing you a status of what is currently happening.

   > Note: If you run into errors during the deployment that indicate a bad request or unauthorized, verify that the user you are logged into the portal with an account that is either a Service Administrator or a Co-Administrator. You won't have permissions to deploy the website otherwise.

7. After a short time, the deployment will complete, and you will be presented with a link to your newly deployed web application. CTRL+Click to open it in a new tab.

8. Try a few different combinations of origin, destination, date, and time in the application. The information you are shown is the result of both the ML API you published, as well as information retrieved from the DarkSky API.

9. Congratulations! You have built and deployed an intelligent system to Azure.

## After the hands-on lab

Duration: 10 minutes

In this exercise, attendees will deprovision any Azure resources that were created in support of the lab.

### Task 1: Delete resource group

1. Using the Azure portal, navigate to the Resource group you used throughout this hands-on lab by selecting **Resource groups** in the menu.

2. Search for the name of your research group and select it from the list.

3. Select **Delete** in the command bar and confirm the deletion by re-typing the Resource group name and selecting **Delete**.

You should follow all steps provided _after_ attending the Hands-on lab.
