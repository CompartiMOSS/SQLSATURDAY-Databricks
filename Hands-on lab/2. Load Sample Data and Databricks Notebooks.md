## Exercise 2: Load Sample Data and Databricks Notebooks

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will implement a classification experiment. You will load the training data from your local machine into a dataset. Then, you will explore the data to identify the primary components you should use for prediction, and use two different algorithms for predicting the classification. You will then evaluate the performance of both algorithms and choose the algorithm that performs best. The model selected will be exposed as a web service that is integrated with the optional sample web app at the end.

### Task 1: Upload the Sample Datasets

1. Before you begin working with machine learning services, there are three datasets you need to load.

2. Download the three CSV sample datasets from here: <http://bit.ly/2wGAqrl> (If you get an error, or the page won't open, try pasting the URL into a new browser window and verify the case sensitive URL is exactly as shown). If still having trouble, a zip file called AdventureWorksTravelDatasets.zip is included in the lab-files folders.

3. Extract the ZIP and verify you have the following files:

   - FlightDelaysWithAirportCodes.csv
   - FlightWeatherWithAirportCodes.csv
   - AirportCodeLocationLookupClean.csv

4. Open your Azure Databricks workspace. Before continuing to the next step, verify that your new cluster is running. Do this by navigating to **Clusters** on the left-hand menu and ensuring that the state of your cluster is **Running**.

   ![The cluster is shown in the Running state.](media/azure-databricks-clusters-running.png 'Clusters')

5. Select **Data** from the menu. Next, select **default** under Databases (if this does not appear, start your cluster). Finally, select **Add Data** above the Tables header.

   ![From the Azure Databricks workspace, select Data, default database, then new table](media/azure-databricks-create-tables.png 'Create new table')

6. Select **Upload File** under Create New Table, and then select either select or drag-and-drop the FlightDelaysWithAirportCodes.csv file into the file area. Select **Create Table with UI**.

   ![Create a new table using the FlightDelaysWithAirportCodes.csv file](media/create-flight-delays-table-ui.png 'Create new table')

7. Select your cluster to preview the table, then select **Preview Table**.

8. Change the Table Name to `flight_delays_with_airport_codes` and select the checkmark for **First row is header**. Select **Create Table**.

   ![Rename table and check the first row is header checkbox](media/flight-delays-attributes.png 'Rename table')

9. Repeat the previous steps for the FlightWeatherWithAirportCode.csv and AirportCodeLocationsClean.csv files, setting the name for each dataset in a similar fashion. There should be a total of three files that are uploaded. Each table should be named as follows:

   - flightweatherwithairportcode_csv to **flight_weather_with_airport_code**
   - flightdelayswithairportcodes_csv to **flight_delays_with_airport_codes**
   - airportcodelocationlookupclean_csv to **airport_code_location_lookup_clean**

   ![Azure Databricks tables shown after all three files uploaded](media/uploaded-data-files.png 'Uploaded data files')

### Task 2: Install Azure ML library on the cluster

1. Select **Clusters** on the left-hand menu, then select your lab cluster to open it.

   ![A screenshot of the Clusters page is shown with the lab cluster highlighted.](media/azure-databricks-cluster.png 'Lab cluster')

2. Select the **Libraries** tab. If you **do not** see the Azure ML library already installed on the cluster, continue to the next step. Otherwise, continue to Task 3.

3. Select **Install New**.

   ![The Libraries tab and Install New button are highlighted.](media/azure-databricks-cluster-install-new.png 'Libraries')

4. In the Install Library dialog, select **PyPi** for the Library Source, then enter the following in the Package field: `azureml-sdk[databricks]`. Select **Install**.

   ![The Install Library dialog is displayed with PyPi selected as the Library Source, and the package name entered into the Package field.](media/azure-databricks-cluster-install-library-pypi.png 'Install Library')

5. **Wait** until the library's status shows as **Installed** before continuing.

   ![The new library is shown with a status of Installed.](media/azure-databricks-cluster-libraries-installed.png 'Libraries')

### Task 3: Open Azure Databricks and complete lab notebooks

1. Download the following file:

   - [BigDataVis.dbc](lab-files/BigDataVis.dbc)

2. Within Azure Databricks, select **Workspace** on the menu, then **Users**, select your user, then select the down arrow on the top of your user workspace. Select **Import**.

   ![Screenshot showing selecting import within the user workspace](media/select-import-in-user-workspace.png 'Import')

3. Within the Import Notebooks dialog, select Import from: file, then drag-and-drop the file or browse to upload it.

   ![Select import from file](media/import-notebooks.png 'Import from file')

4. After importing, expand the new **BigDataVis** folder.

5. Before you begin, make sure you attach your cluster to the notebooks, using the dropdown. You will need to do this for each notebook you open. There are 5 notebooks included in the BigDataVis.dbc

   ![Select your cluster to attach it to the notebook](media/attach-cluster-to-notebook.png 'Attach cluster to notebook')

6. Run each cell of the notebooks located in the **Exercise 2** folder (01, 02 and 03) individually by selecting within the cell, then entering **Ctrl+Enter** on your keyboard. Pay close attention to the instructions within the notebook so you understand each step of the data preparation process.

   ![The notebooks within the Exercise 2 folder are displayed.](media/azure-databricks-exercise-2.png 'Exercise 2 folder')

7. Do NOT run the `Clean up` part of Notebook 3 (i.e. this command: `webservice.delete()`). You will need the URL of your Machine Learning Model exposed later in **Exercise 8: Deploy intelligent web app (Optional Lab)**. _Note: you could get this URL by updating your Notebook by adding this line `print(webservice.scoring_uri)` or by going to your Azure Machine Learning service workspace via the Azure portal and then to the "Deployments" blade._

8. Do NOT run any notebooks within the Exercise 5 or 6 folders. They will be discussed later in the lab.
