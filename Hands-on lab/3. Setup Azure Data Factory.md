## Exercise 3: Setup Azure Data Factory

Duration: 20 minutes

In this exercise, you will create a baseline environment for Azure Data Factory development for further operationalization of data movement and processing. You will create a Data Factory service, and then install the Data Management Gateway which is the agent that facilitates data movement from on-premises to Microsoft Azure.

### Task 1: Download and stage data to be processed

1. Open a web browser.

2. Download the AdventureWorks sample data from <http://bit.ly/2zi4Sqa>.

3. Extract it to a new folder called **C:\\Data**.

### Task 2: Install and configure Azure Data Factory Integration Runtime on your machine

1. To download the latest version of Azure Data Factory Integration Runtime, go to <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=39717>.

   ![The Azure Data Factory Integration Runtime Download webpage displays.](media/image112.png 'Azure Data Factory Integration Runtime Download webpage')

2. Select Download, then choose the download you want from the next screen.

   ![Under Choose the download you want, the MSI file is selected.](media/image113.png 'Choose the download you want section')

3. Run the installer, once downloaded.

4. When you see the following screen, select Next.

   ![The Welcome page in the Microsoft Integration Runtime Setup Wizard displays.](media/image114.png 'Microsoft Integration Runtime Setup Wizard')

5. Check the box to accept the terms and click Next.

   ![On the End-User License Agreement page, the check box to accept the license agreement is selected, as is the Next button.](media/image115.png 'End-User License Agreement page')

6. Accept the default Destination Folder, and select Next.

   ![On the Destination folder page, the destination folder is set to C;\Program Files\Microsoft Integration Runtime\ and the Next button is selected.](media/image116.png 'Destination folder page')

7. Choose Install to complete the installation.

   ![On the Ready to install Microsoft Integration Runtime page, the Install button is selected.](media/image117.png 'Ready to install page')

8. Select Finish once the installation has completed.

   ![On the Completed the Microsoft Integration Runtime Setup Wizard page, the Finish button is selected.](media/image118.png 'Completed the Wizard page')

9. After clicking Finish, the following screen will appear. Keep it open for now. You will come back to this screen once the Data Factory in Azure has been provisioned, and obtain the gateway key so we can connect Data Factory to this "on-premises" server.

### Task 3: Configure Azure Data Factory

1. Launch a new browser window, and navigate to the Azure portal (<https://portal.azure.com>). Once prompted, log in with your Microsoft Azure credentials. If prompted, choose whether your account is an organization account or a Microsoft account. This will be based on which account was used to provision your Azure subscription that is being used for this lab.

2. From the side menu in the Azure portal, choose **Resource groups**, then enter your resource group name into the filter box, and select it from the list.

3. Next, select your Azure Data Factory service from the list.

4. On the Data Factory blade, select **Author & Monitor** under Actions.

   ![In the Azure Data Factory blade, under Actions, the Author & Monitor option is selected.](media/adf-author-monitor.png 'Author & Monitor')

5. A new page will open in another tab or new window. Within the Azure Data Factory site, select **Author** (the pencil icon) on the menu.

   ![Select Author from the menu](media/adf-home-author-link.png 'Author link on ADF home page')

6. Now, select **Connections** at the bottom of Factory Resources (1), then select the **Integration Runtimes** tab (2), and finally select **+ New** (3).

   ![Select Connections at the bottom of the page, then select the Integration Runtimes tab, and select New.](media/adf-new-ir.png 'Steps to create a new Integation Runtime connection')

7. In the Integration Runtime Setup blade that appears, select "Perform data movement and dispatch activities to external computes", then select **Next**.

   ![Select Perform data movement and dispatch activities to external computes](media/adf-ir-setup-1.png 'Integration Runtime Setup step 1')

8. Select **Self-Hosted** then select **Next**.

   ![Select Private Network then Next](media/adf-ir-setup-2.png 'Integration Runtime Setup step 2')

9. Enter a **Name**, such as bigdatagateway-\[initials\], and select **Next**.

   ![Enter a Name and select Next](media/adf-ir-setup-3.png 'Integration Runtime Setup step 3')

10. Under Option 2: Manual setup, copy the Key1 authentication key value by selecting the Copy button, then select **Finish**.


    ![Copy the Key1 value](media/adf-ir-setup-4.png 'Integration Runtime Setup step 4')

11. _Don't close the current screen or browser session_.

12. Paste the **Key1** value into the box in the middle of the Microsoft Integration Runtime Configuration Manager screen.

    ![The Microsoft Integration Runtime Configuration Manager Register Integration Runtime page displays.](media/image127.png 'Microsoft Integration Runtime Configuration Manager')

13. Select **Register**.

14. It will take a minute or two to register. If it takes more than a couple of minutes, and the screen does not respond or returns an error message, close the screen by selecting the **Cancel** button.

15. The next screen will be New Integration Runtime (Self-hosted) Node. Select Finish.

    ![The Microsoft Integration Runtime Configuration Manager New Integration Runtime (Self-hosted) Node page displays.](media/adf-ir-self-hosted-node.png 'Microsoft Integration Runtime Configuration Manager')

16. You will then get a screen with a confirmation message. Select the **Launch Configuration Manager** button to view the connection details.

    ![The Microsoft Integration Runtime Configuration Manager Node is connected to the cloud service page displays with connection details.](media/adf-ir-launch-config-manager.png 'Microsoft Integration Runtime Configuration Manager')
